"""Exploitation of the user is a dominant business model on today's Web. Whether that's in the form of data being gathered about you, onerous terms of service you need to abide by, or privacy policies that treat you like a commodity, it's hard not to feel like everything is designed to turn you into a device for making someone else massive amounts of money. Today's Web is short on humanity, and that's something we do need to fix. But the problem is deep and systemic. Fixing it will not happen overnight; it may well not happen at all."""
