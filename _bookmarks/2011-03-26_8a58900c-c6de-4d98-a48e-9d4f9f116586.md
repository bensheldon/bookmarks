Winning quote from the chamber of commerce: <br><br>"Instead of removing them all, maybe we could add a business element to it," he said. "One that depicts the importance of employer and employee."<br><br>And let's not forget the National Guard, billy clubs and teargas either.<br><br>Oh, and the quote from the Bioware LGBTQ thing: "...privilege always lies with the majority. They're so used to being catered to that they see the lack of catering as an imbalance. "
