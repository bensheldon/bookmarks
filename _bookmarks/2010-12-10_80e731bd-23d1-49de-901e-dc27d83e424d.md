title: 'Wordpress: Separate trackbacks from comments [updated]'

This article describes a way of separating trackbacks from comments in your WordPress theme when you are using WordPress 2.7+. I have noticed that a lot of tutorials on the internet that explain how this is done are based on older versions of WordPress. These tutorials donâ€™t work anymore because WordPress uses a different way of displaying comments now. This new way makes it easier to separate trackbacks from comments but the outdated tutorials can be very confusing for inexperienced users who want to separate trackbacks from comments in their own WordPress theme and rely on these tutorials.
