"[Developers] can use their skills to effect government change by building software that disrupts the standard way of providing effective services to citizens."<br><br>...but how can developers, as the outsiders this post celebrates, actually know what are the transformative problems to solve? Especially recognizing that the vast majority of potential developers are affluent/educated, are their city-service interactions representative of the majority of constituents.<br><br>So if a developer is not representative, that means they must be highly engaged---both with government and community. And looking at those examples of App initiatives, Code for America is the only one that seems to create a level of access. Developers may be great at creating technical functionality, but identifying the problem and the solution their functionality slips between requires a different process than these app contests/initiatives create. And one that seems to be breathlessly overlooked.
