The common feature in all three methods is an affirmative action approach: the active promotion of the underrepresented group. Passive methods (such as increasing potential rewards for everyone) do improve participation by women, but they also improve men's performance as well, which leaves the gender gap in place. Affirmative action, on the other hand, not only changes the odds of success by women, but (according to the authors of a related study) also increases their confidence and willingness to compete in the first place.   If the competitors know they have a higher chance of success before the contest even begins, the authors suggest, they are more likely to enter it with a positive view of their own abilities. In addition, excessive confidence in male competitors is reduced because they know rewards will be distributed in a different manner.
