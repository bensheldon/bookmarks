title: Migrate a Rails App from Heroku to Dokku [Step by Step Tutorial]
tags: []
---

<blockquote>Dokku is dev ops for dummies and a cheaper alternative to Heroku. Recently I've migrated a couple of my projects to it. In this blog post, I will describe how to setup and migrate a Rails app to Dokku with PostgreSQL, Sidekiq, Redis and Let's Encrypt or Cloudflare for free SSL.</blockquote>
