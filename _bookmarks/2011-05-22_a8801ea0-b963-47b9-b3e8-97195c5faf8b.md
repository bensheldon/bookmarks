"'Go into the kitchen of a Taco Bell today, and you'll find a strong counterargument to any notion that the U.S. has lost its manufacturing edge.'(WSJ)  ...As much as we talk about food in regard to Fast Food Restaurants, what they really sell, what they really thrive at is process. The quality of the food is secondary. The priority of these places is to squeeze as much profit out of every minute of being open as they possibly can."
