A commenter says that Harvest originally wanted to move to a lot across from the Curley school... that is now a parking lot... which is why they are where they are now... and proposing to build this new grocery about a half mile away. <br><br>I'm not really pro-Whole Foods, but I'm annoyed that "community planning" seems to be limited to saying "no".
