As you can probably tell I'm bummed about the Flip being, well, flipped and abandoned. I think it could have served as the "my phone takes pictures but I'll get something a little nicer---not pro-am, but good" of video. As for buying a new model every year, they could have added an accessory shoe and sold people mini shotgun mics and camera lights. Kodak's Zi8 has just audio-in and people are eating that shit up. At least, everyone I know who I steer to the Zi8 comes back with a shotgun, 2 lavs and a superbright.
