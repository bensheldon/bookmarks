> My experiences as a coach told me people were missing the point, with all this talk of unit tests, acceptance tests, functional tests, integration tests… Kent Beck’s style of TDD is a very smart way to develop software, so I tried removing the word “test” when I was coaching it, replacing it with things like behaviour, examples, scenarios etc. The result was very encouraging: People seemed to “get” TDD much quicker when I avoided referring to testing.
