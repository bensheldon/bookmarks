I'm kind've surprised Gruber doesn't mention the iPod Touch. Then again, no one mentions the iPod Touch, but that's the device that seems to be most competing with the Kindle Fire. And if the rumors are true that Apple is killing off the Classic and Shuffle, then the Fire might just kill the iPod Touch.... Leaving just the Nano. Amazon kills the iPod, you read it here first. <br><br>Ok, back to complaining about nonprofits and civic tech.
