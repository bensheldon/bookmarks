<blockquote>One thing that I think many have found lacking, however, is has_many and accepts_nested_attributes_for functionality. I found myself in this boat recently when I wanted to use these form objects to create multiple records. How can I have a form that can create arbitrarily many records and have validation errors appear for each record I'm trying to create, without associations?</blockquote>
