So even beyond The Thick of It and Veep and In the Loop—the latter of which features David Rasche, AKA Karl, as the nastiest US senator ever put on-screen—Armstrong has done a lot of work that begins from the worldview that, because those in power can choose what veneer gets presented as "sane" and "rational," the world's afflictions arise from that dissonance between the things we're conditioned to accept and the reasons we're being conditioned to accept them in the first place.

From this vantage point, Logan is basically the horrors of the world manifested in human form: he holds no illusions, except that nothing else is possible, and alternates between a weary man who barely cares about the trappings he's waltzing through and the sheer fury he fires off at anyone who dares to suggest that there's more to the world than this.
