Wow, it's like they wrote One Economy right into it:<br><br>'The deal requires Comcast to provide "approximately" 2.5 million low income households with high speed Internet for less than $10 a month. To this population the ISP must also sell PCs, netbooks, or similar computer equipment at prices below $150, and offer a host of "digital literacy educational opportunities."'
