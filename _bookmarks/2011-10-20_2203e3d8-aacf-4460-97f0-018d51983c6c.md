Summary - Wikipedia is about people, not technology, which is why Wikipedia is successful; but being about people is boring and repetitive, so Wikipedia should  be more about technology because... umm... then they'd have even more success.... despite what I wrote earlier... just wave your hands over that... technology, that's the ticket... yes, sir.
