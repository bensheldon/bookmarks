I wanted to have a way for my Google Reader notes to be “automagically” tweeted, but not the regular shares (so I don’t flood my Twitter stream).  I don’t know if there are already other solutions for this, I made this essentially to learn a bit more about Yahoo Pipes.  It also uses twitterfeed, a very nice service which fetches a RSS stream and tweets a small blurb plus a shortened link for each item from that stream .
