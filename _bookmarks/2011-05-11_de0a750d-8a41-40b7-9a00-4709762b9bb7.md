In Boston we're focusing  advocacy on getting cyclists to heed these laws. And the reason is that pedestrians are complaining to the city about bicyclists being hazardous---which is slowing implementation of more bike friendly infrastructure. <br><br>A bike is to a pedestrian as a car is to a bike: too close, too fast, and unpredictable. <br><br>And I totally agree about the statistics, relative harm, whathaveyou. But at the political level--the level where transportation reforms take place---constituents are what matter most. <br><br>Personally, I think this is a case where things are gonna get worse (more restrictive bicycling enforcement but better infrastructure) before they get better (more progressive enforcement and better infrastructure). I don't think both can be done at the same time without adversarial deadlock. And as we know in Massachusetts, even assholes can eventually be accepted.
