"a reflection of the necessities that come from trying to provide reliable systems based on increasingly complex and unreliable stacks of software and infrastructure."<br><br>I've been playing with node.js all week and this is what I've experienced. I'll install a module (probably because it's a dependency of some other module), and it'll want me to compile something. WTF. At least the MAMP stack is widely understandable. <br><br>I assume this is what developing with Ruby is like: "did you try the blanketyblank gem? It's just like such and such other gem you might use, but had (some marginalish obscure improvement)." <br><br>Y'know, I didn't, cause when I went to Github I saw that it was 8 months out of date, has 4 issues responses of the "I'll get on that tomorrow"-6 months ago variety, and the Readme says to checkout some other gem the author developed that does what this gem does but moreso. oh, and here are some more dependencies for you.
