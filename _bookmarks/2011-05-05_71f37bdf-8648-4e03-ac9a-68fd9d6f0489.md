Apparently someone has not heard of "food deserts" or noticed the statistics on food insecurity. <br><br>A better comparison municipal water. It's required to serve everyone at an equally high standard. Yet rich people still feel the need to cast aspersions at its quality and thus purchase private bottled water which is of questionable provenance. Which leads to a failure to invest in public infrastructure and then an actual decline in quality of muni water, thus justifying the bottled water purchases by those who can afford it. ...wait, nevermind, that's a horrible comparison.
