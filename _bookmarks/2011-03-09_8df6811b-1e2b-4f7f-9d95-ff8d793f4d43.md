I've been thinking a lot about pricing lately (probably because I'll be out of a job soon). It seems like the make-it-or-break-it piece of a lot of projects/startups is customer service---and good customer service costs money. Development is cheap, marketing can be cheap, but the typical "we'll let the community solve your problems" is the road to fail or irrelevance. Sure, you can point to some projects (Gooooooogle) that have shitty customer service, but you're probably out of their league of lucky breaks.
