title: The Inside Story of How Facebook Responded to Tunisian Hacks
tags: []
---

From the comments: <br><br>"Just to put this in context : Facebook was aware of major problem going on between Ben Ali's internet police and the Tunisian population since may 2010. They were alerted of the first password phasing attempt by ReadWriteWeb France after Slim Amamou, now State Sec. for youth wrote a post in RWW last june. Not to mention they were regularly updated with list of local opposition members and artist who's profile were deactivated or hacked.<br><br>All this is PR bullshit form Facebook. They knew at least 6 months prior to the Tunisian revolution what was going on. We have numerous post and email exchange with Facebook exec. and PR staff to prove this."
