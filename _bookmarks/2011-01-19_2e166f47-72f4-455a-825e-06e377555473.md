The Globe loves to bash on unions though this critique is pretty fair. (disclosure: I am a member of the MTA). Liked this note at the end: <br><br>> PS: I would draw your attention to the extra pay that teachers can get for coaching and advising, last page of the TBF report. <br><br>$10,834 for football head coach; <br>$5,415 for intramural assistant softball coach;<br>comparable amounts for other sports coaches;<br>$1,390 for Drama Club advisor (who presumably directs the plays?? Am I wrong?)<br>$1,390 for academic debate coach.
