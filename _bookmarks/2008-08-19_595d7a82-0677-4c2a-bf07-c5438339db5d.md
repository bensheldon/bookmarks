This study will examine the development and evolution of semiconductor electronics, and in particular attempt to more completely explain "Moore's Law," a phenomenon unique to the rapid innovation cycles of this technology and thus the semiconductor industry as a whole. Gordon E. Moore's simple observation more than three decades ago that circuit densities of semiconductors had and would continue to double on a regular basis has not only been validated, but has since been dubbed, "Moore's Law" and now carries with it enormous influence. It is increasingly referred to as a controlling variable -- some have referred to it as a "self-fulfilling prophecy." The historical regularity and predictability of "Moore's Law" produce organizing and coordinating effects throughout the semiconductor industry that not only set the pace of innovation, but define the rules and very nature of competition. And since semiconductors increasingly comprise a larger portion of electronics components and systems
