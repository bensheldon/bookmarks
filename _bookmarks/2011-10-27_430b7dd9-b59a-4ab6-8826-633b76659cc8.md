> "They are not interested in debate (or what Enlightenment philosophers called "dialectic") but consensus."<br><br>I can't stand Rushkoff's technology metaphors. Also, he's making some allusions to Utopianism (or as I read it, 60s-style "back to the land" communalism); I hope the movement remains Occupy and not Escape.
