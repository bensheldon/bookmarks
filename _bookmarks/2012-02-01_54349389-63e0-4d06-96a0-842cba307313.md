That’s the first reason we’re thrilled about the widget-microformat approach iBooks is taking — we can build to the spirit of the functionality, rather than just mimic the functionality. We can parse the intention of a microformat — it’s impossible to parse the intention of a chunk of JavaScript. We’re not forced to build an iBooks clone, which work would hold no attraction for us.

The second reason is that the ebook experience is kinda shit. For lots of reasons. It has been worse, but it could be so much better. Right now a bunch of smart companies, including Apple, and including Amazon with their KF8, and also including Booki.sh, are hammering away at that problem.
