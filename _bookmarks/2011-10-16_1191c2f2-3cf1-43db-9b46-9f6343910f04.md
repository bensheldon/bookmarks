Interesting article, especially in regards to government sales growth curves. Also, this reinforces my worldview:<br><br>> Being poor also changes how you think about education. Interestingly, in the US, the people who are most willing to try new things are the poor and uneducated because they have a similar incentive structure to a person in rural India. Their default state is “screwed.”
