I would be honestly surprised if O'Keefe's application for nonprofit status was denied. Unless the guy is an idiot (he's clearly an ass) it is relatively straightforward to submit a 1023 for "newsgathering in the public interest", demonstrating public support, and having clear compensation. To be honest, you have to be a real fuckup to NOT be granted nonprofit status these days (the only group I know who was temporarily held up was for software development). <br><br>Im surprised this article didn't mention who was listed as officers of the corporation, because that would be important (especially if some of them received compensation). Then again, I searched DC and new Jersey's (where OKeefe is from) incorporations and couldn't find anything close.
