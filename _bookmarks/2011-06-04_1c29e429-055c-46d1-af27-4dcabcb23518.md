title: Hey Kids, Build Your Own Video Games With Stencyl

The problem with building kinetic games in Scratch (and maybe they solve it with this, though I'm dubious) is you have do write all your own geometry and physics modeling. Now I have a degree in math and am pretty comfortable calculating (or rather faking) vectors and transformations and crap---but it's tough. I'm not discounting that kids won't have fun and make games with this, but kids will have fun and make games out of a cardboard box.
