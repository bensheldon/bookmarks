title: Mobile technology is turning us all into feudal serfs

As much as I spout this kind of crap from time to time, it's important not to conflate capital, freedom (liberty) and ownership. While interrelated, they are not the same. Also, this article claims the Digital Divide is dead (hah!), and lacks the awareness of the infrastructure that lies between our physical beings and the cloud---to keep the metaphor going, this would be the turnpike that keeps serfs from escaping to breathe the city-air-makes-you-free (or whatever that German compound word is).
