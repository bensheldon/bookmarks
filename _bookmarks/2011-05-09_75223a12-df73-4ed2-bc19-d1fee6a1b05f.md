"How do you get to a place where you’re the trusted entity? The short response is that it doesn’t come at the time of an emergency. This applies if you’re an individual or a large organization starting something off; you have to have credibility and trust from others in order to gain traction."<br><br>And I would argue you have to get this trust before you deliver a product/service.
