title: Twitter Community Organizing Rules for Non Profits
tags: []

Ben's standard pet peeve: nowhere does this transfer the real world organizing principles of building power, leadership and local structures. Heck, where is the one on one? <br><br>I mean, when the telephone was invented, how long of a period was there where all of the telephone organizing how-tos consisted of "speak clearly and make sure you can hear the earpiece"?<br><br>And it's cool if Twitter is the direct mail of tomorrow (today!), but I'd expect a little less breathlessness if framed as such.
