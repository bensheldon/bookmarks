11. "A director is not personally liable for monetary damages for failure of the benefit corporation to create general  or specific public benefits." [B-Labs info sheet]<br><br>I think BCorps and L3Cs are a bunch of whooey as currently composed/articulated: the stick is vague and the IRS doesn't recognize the carrot.

Who has standing to sue these entities over non-benefit? <br><br>I recognize the desire for ownership that a nonprofit doesn't offer (non-distribution), but I'm at a loss for a scenario in which it's worth the trouble---not to mention the entrepreneurial literacy---to adopt these models in any of the community contexts in which they're hocked.
