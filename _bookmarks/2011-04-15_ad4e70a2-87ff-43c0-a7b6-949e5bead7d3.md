I wish apple would just make a Syncing Bridge between CoreData and MySQL (or I guess a NoSQL). That being said, I wish anyone would make a syncing bridge library between HTML5 Local Storage and a webservice (mySQL), preferably with jQuery---cause thinking about edge cases (like multiple devices) gives me stomach pains. Maybe I should use mysqllite and a a JavaScript git client
