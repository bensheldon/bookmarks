Too bad the redesign is BORING. It's full of naked headlines with not even a byline or publication date/time. Sure, it makes me want to drag my browser window, but it doesn't make me want to click, let alone return and have to re-scan all those headline lists to see what's new.  Maybe $4 will make me more captive, but I'll probably forget about it like Readability (reminder: cancel that).
