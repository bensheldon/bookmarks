A great story. Though I had to read 2/3s of it before I found what I was looking for, or rather, knew I wouldn't: "We had tooled around with innovation, piling features into our web browser game. But when it came down to it, we hadn't baked-in monetization."<br><br>A typical story seems to be: it turned out to be a niche product that had already penetrated its market by the time it left Beta... thus alienating all those people who expected it to continue being free.
