Fascinating---mostly because they disagree. I hated the Wired article about hackerspaces that came out about a year ago because it was filled with breathless homogeneities about "accessibility for everyone" but then you look at the pictures and it's all middle-aged white guys.<br><br>And in terms of self-criticism, maybe the issue isn't getting more diversity into places where white guys hang out, but getting more coverage of where women and persons of color hang out. If the desire to hack is a human universal, surely it's taking place in communities of color/women/queer/etc. its just not being reported or even being identified as such. The show "Pimp My Ride"--for its faults--was hacking in every sense.  <br><br>Back to the white guys: pointing out the economic inequalities and social mores that enforce a leisure-class would ungraciously link hackers with Victorian bitties knitting doilies by gaslight. And heaven knows it's tough to be breathless about that.
