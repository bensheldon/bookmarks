Great piece by Kari Lydersen -- efforts like this, which stand a chance of influencing and even subverting global capitalism through labor organizing, are very appealing to me. The idea that steel workers in Gary and miners in Mexico could work to level wage and quality of life disparities (and see improvements for both parties) is also really compelling. When I hear about silliness like the Chicago group sending computers to and planning distance learning with Accra, I wish they were more focused on solidarity and concrete economic outcomes, like what Kari describes here.
