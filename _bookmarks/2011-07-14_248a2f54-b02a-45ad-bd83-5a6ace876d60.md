PHP category judge was Matt Mullenweg, of Wordpress. <br><br>Also I'm gonna ask DonorsChoose the question "Will they push for this to become a Wordpress.com hosted plugin?" ...and will Print & Share be added to the "Share" panel? and the iPhone app (non-winning for fucks sake) be featured on the front page? And the 'what makes for a successful project'-analysis be added to the Creation FAQ? And the "macs for classrooms"-analysis be sent to their development office? ...and so forth. <br><br>BTW, there is a non-winning showcase:<br><a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/hacking-education-showcase">http://www.donorschoose.org/hacking-education-showcase</a>
