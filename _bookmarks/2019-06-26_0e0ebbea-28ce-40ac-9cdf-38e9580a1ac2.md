title: Backup Heroku PostgreSQL to AWS S3 Bucket [Step by Step Tutorial]
tags:
- heroku
---

<blockquote>Heroku offers a robust backups system for it's PostgreSQL database plugin. Unfortunately, you can irreversibly lose all your data and backups just by typing a single command. It might seem improbable, but still, I would rather not bet my startup's existence on a single faulty bash line. In this tutorial, I will describe how to set up a proprietary Heroku Postgres backups system to a secure AWS S3 bucket.</blockquote>
