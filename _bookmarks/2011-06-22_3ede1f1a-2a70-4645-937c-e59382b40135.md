The beauty of the internet is that I can usually just quote my thoughts from the comments: "...reasoning was really a branch of rhetoric until Socrates and/or Plato started pretending otherwise."<br><br>I have a blog in draft that uses the awkward adoption of the trivium into modern quadrivium as a snide aside.
