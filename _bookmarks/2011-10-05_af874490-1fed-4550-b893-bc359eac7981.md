(At least) one of my former-Corps members is in the leadership tent. It was a  running joke of saying when NOT to wear your AmeriCorps shirt ("don't wear it to a bank robbery"); I told her I'd send her some shirts for her court-date if she gets picked up. <br><br>I'm kind've a statement nerd (<a href="http://www.island94.org/2010/02/mount-vernon-port-huron-and-sharon-statements-in-comparison/">http://www.island94.org/2010/02/mount-vernon-port-huron-and-sharon-statements-in-comparison/</a>) so it's exciting to think this might be excepted in a textbook 40 years from now---what's the futuristic-e-book equivalent of "opposite page on a yellow background"?<br><br>[ok, that's my optimism for the day]
