Markov Chain Algorithms
(A not very technical explanation)


How the algorithms work.

Markov algorithms do not require either mathematics or computers. It is possible to perform a Markov text generation algorithm with a pencil and paper (I will discuss how to do this below). The only other thing required is an input text. There are mathematically oriented accounts available that also discuss such matters. This one will avoid equations entirely. To illustrate my discussion, I will use this paragraph.
