I have a bone to pick with bitly: they use both upper and lowercase letters in their shortened URLs which makes transcribing them hell (especially among folks with lower digital literacy): This is a major practical flaw of my Print & Share app (and also that we're using helvetica which also makes ones and el's ambiguous too).
