> Narrative is the great litmus test. Larry Fink should have asked: What big and important problem is your business solving. Narrative is also a tool to provide uniquely creative answers to sincere questions. Even if the story isn’t obvious or watertight, a narrative approach will highlight what works and what is weak and can be very creative in merging contingencies under a common purpose that matters. That is how story is written: backwards and forwards at the same time. What can’t be written but has to be earned with courage: the choice of a story that is ambitious enough for the world to care.
