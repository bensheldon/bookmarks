No offense, but it probably is: "Maybe it’s the engineer in me, but we’re really lacking tools for widespread engagement, coordination and replication."<br><br>I'd say we're lacking organizers, space (physical and intellectual) and funding (name one major foundation that funds replication... no, not replicability, replication)
