What is it you do?  Whatever it is, you write for a living.  Memos, proposals, emails, commit messages, performance reviews, user stories, code – you write for a living.  The better you write anything – the better you write everything.  You write an email and then you decide that it is better not to send it. So you delete it.  You find the code that is never called and you eliminate it. It is just noise.  What about that code that is called all the time?  I hope it is good.  I hope it has been tested and profiled. This is where working your magic can really pay off.
