This is inspiring, though i think it would have trouble in rural areas where there isn't a diversity of opportunity. And of course, for the people this program doesn't help, fault the program, not the people.<br><br>Liked this:<br><br>"Today, 85 percent of the $400 billion that the government spends to encourage things like home ownership, college attendance, investment and small business ends up in the pockets of the top 20 percent of earners (and half goes to the top 5 percent). Very little ends up helping the working poor. On the other hand, many social benefits cut off when a family’s income rises roughly 30 percent above the poverty line — which is still a far cry from being out of poverty. For the middle class, resources are linked to initiative; for the poor, they are linked to problems."
