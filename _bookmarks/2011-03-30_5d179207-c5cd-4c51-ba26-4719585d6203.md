Diversity is the end, inclusion the means.  <br><br>Quote: I worked for a while with a group of civil rights leaders who frequently referred to the “chocolate chip model” of politics, where they were engaged by mostly white coalitions who were looking for diversity but not inclusion. Typically these groups would create a strategy and, only later, look to build out their diversity. These new diverse players were very welcome, as long as they don’t express dissent from the rest of the group or tip any balance of power.
