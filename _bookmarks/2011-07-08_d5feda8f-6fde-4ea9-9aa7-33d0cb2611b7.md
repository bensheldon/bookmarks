I'll just leave this quote from Malkia Cyril here:<br><br>"Why does [telecom] have such power in civic organizations from the DC beltway to your hometown? Well it isn’t because these organizations are dumb, or simply because they are struggling for resources or ill-informed. No. These organizations are often run by brilliant leaders of integrity. Instead, I think it’s because many groups have internalized a worldview that prioritizes getting our piece of the American pie, rather than one that seeks to remake the pie into something we can not only eat, but create and control."<br><br><a href="http://centerformediajustice.org/2011/06/11/why-glaad-doesnt-represent-me/">http://centerformediajustice.org/2011/06/11/why-glaad-doesnt-represent<wbr>-me/</a>
