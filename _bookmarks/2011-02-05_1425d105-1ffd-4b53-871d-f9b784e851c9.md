I guess I take that slide the other way: humans have the equivalent of the solar system between our ears, while computers have to travel that whole distance. Not to mention that we don't have to take multiple trips out there: if we recall Molly Ringwald, we get Ducky for free (not to mention Andrew McCarthy, Mannequin, and the episode of Sex in the City where Carrie jokes to Big about a watermelon at the courthouse). Sure, computers can free associate, but they're nowhere near that good.
