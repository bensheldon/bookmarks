My college experience was that people who didn't have a clear interest went into business (there were exceptions: I went into math). The cruel joke though was that our university (UCSB) didn't have a business management program, just business accounting. I had hallmates who required several quarters to realize this (though to be fair, we were a 5 minute walk from a surf break).
