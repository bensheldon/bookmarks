Phil Gyford calls this "friction" (and yes, I'm being sarcastic):<br><a href="http://www.gyford.com/phil/writing/2010/06/09/todays-guardian.php">http://www.gyford.com/phil/writing/2010/06/09/todays-guardian.php</a><br><br>Though actually I'm a little salty because I just got back from the National Conference for Media Reform and they were doing so good avoiding talking about social media until the final plenary when all of the banalisms came gushing out about the power of human interaction as mediated by a bunch of slick privileged guys with computer science degrees---well, they didn't actually say that, but that was the general gist. <br><br>Meanwhile, all of the people of color, queer, previously incarcerated, in poverty, etc.---who we just spent 3 days rending ourselves in grief over their lack of access to tell their stories---get to listen to these young men schmooze around in their jeans and sweatshirts and say shit like "people just want to be empowered". As if what was holding back 500 years of struggle as culminated in today's broad-based, anti-oppression action networks was a lack of user-generated content.<br><br>So anyway, fuck this (eg what Neven is writing about).
