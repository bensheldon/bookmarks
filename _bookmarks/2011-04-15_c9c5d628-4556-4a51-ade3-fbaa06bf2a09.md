Sorry to keep flooding the channel with Flip stuff, but it utterly bums me out since the Flip was a great example of accessible and culturally transformative technology. I remember when it was only sold at CVS as a "disposable" and I had cable access producers walk up to me and say "I just got this camera for $20, can you help me hack it?". At conferences it was like Bam! everyone who was carrying a GL2 the previous year was now jamming a Flip in your face---not to mention many more people who never carried a camera unless they were "on a shoot". People who are still carrying their Canon A40 still camera (the 8 year old one that takes 4 AA batteries), and would never buy a smartphone (because they couldn't/wouldn't do a contract) were dropping money on these things like crazy. <br><br>I sure hope Cisco is wicked smart about this decision, because otherwise they're only assholes.
