I gave a session titled "Presenters and Decorators: A Code Tour" at RailsConf 2012. The Presenter and Decorator patterns are very useful approaches to keeping your Rails apps clean. I wanted to talk about presenters for a couple of reasons. First, I think we don't talk about the View layer in our Model-View-Controller apps as much as we should. And second, I think that although "Presenters" have been around for 5+ years, we continue to misunderstand them.
