"We are the 99 percent.<br> We want a society that works for 100 percent.<br> How we care for one another is a moral question.<br> How we divide the nationâ€™s prosperity is an ethical question. <br> How we witness to injustice is a faith question.<br> Thank you to the prophets in our midst.<br> Thank you to the public servants in our midst.<br> Thank you for giving us voices.<br> Thank you for amplifying our voices.<br> Thank you for creating a vision for a more just America.  May we together be blessed and go forward.<br> Amen."
