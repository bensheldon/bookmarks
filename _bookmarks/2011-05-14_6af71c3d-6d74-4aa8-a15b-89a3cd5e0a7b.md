"<a href="http://Alpha.gov.uk">Alpha.gov.uk</a> is an experimental prototype of a single UK Government website. It aims to be as simple as possible, and to place the needs of citizens first.<br><br>"Developed in under three months by a small team within the Government Digital Service, it is a direct response to Martha Lane Fox's recent review of <a href="http://gov.uk">gov.uk</a>, which demanded revolution, not evolution, in the way Government services are delivered online.<br><br>"The prototype is not complete and may not be accurate. Please don't rely on it.<br><br>"The purpose of putting this early prototype public is to test what are relatively radical design ideas before a huge amount of time and public money has been spent. We need your feedback!"
