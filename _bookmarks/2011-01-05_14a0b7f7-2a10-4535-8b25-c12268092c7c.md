For one, the speed penalty of using requestAction is quite prohibitive. The main slowdown is that every time you call requestAction, a full dispatch cycle takes place. This is pretty inefficient given that you probably already know what exact Controller/action you want to call up. A much bigger reason is that you will create a debugging nightmare for yourself. As soon has you have requestAction calls that invoke requestAction calls that invoke requestAction calls - you're screwed. If somewhere along the chain odd things happen (like a bug in your Auth system, some controller's / component's beforeFilter) debugging is going to become a major pain.
