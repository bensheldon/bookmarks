This is excellent news: not only that you can request data in useable formats (eg native Excel xls) but that you can request document metadata (creation/modification info) too. You of course can't request data (or reports/analysis) they don't have, but it's good that judges recognize that agencies are not fulfilling their lawful obligations to provide what they do have in their native/working format.
