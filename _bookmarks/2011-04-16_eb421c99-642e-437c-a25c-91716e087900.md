title: 'Show your support: Bike lanes on Mass Ave'

In case you missed it: in 6 days we got 1,000 petition signatures (300 online, 700 from volunteers on standing on Mass Ave. over the weekend and in the evening rush hour) and we had 125+ people at the public meeting. We also added 600 people to our mailing list, had a Boston Globe editorial published from our Director (a Globe editor rode past our petitioning volunteers). <br><br>One caveat is that the meeting turnout itself was less diverse than I would have liked. We had one man from Dorchester make the point that we need the bike lanes for this 2/3rds of a mile, but we also need lanes and facilities at the other end of Mass Ave too---he got the loudest ovation. I compare his comments to a Harvard Transportation Professor who asked the city to invest full-dutch in this section: it's clear we need to have wider conversations about bicycle investment priorities because resources are finite (even with the mayor's support of these initiatives). <br><br>For my contributions (organizing the electronic petition and online content) I was named (1 of 14) Volunteer(s) of the Month (whoopee!). Though it did distract me from the membership referral competition tool I'm building for our summer drive, err... ride. And now I just volunteered to set up a Write the Governor advocacy campaign for bike paths in Eastie (yeah ServiceSpeak!).
