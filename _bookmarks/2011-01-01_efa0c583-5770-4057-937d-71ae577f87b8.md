Quote---Like so many Bostonians who grew up with the song, Davey had never heard the lines in which Charlie says he is “sore and disgusted and … absolutely busted,’’ or in which a conductor expresses sympathy for Charlie’s plight. That’s because the clean-cut Kingston Trio cut the lyrics to avoid causing trouble, wary of the blacklisted fate of the Weavers, folk artists they admired. They changed the final stanza to plug a made-up candidate named George O’Brien, instead of the real Walter A. O’Brien — a labor organizer and Progressive Party activist whose politics made him a target of the Massachusetts Commission on Communism in the mid-1950s.
