I'm looking at you retweeters (especially those of you who admit you don't actually read the links you retweet... And the individuals where it's implicitly obvious):<br><br>"Another implication here is that people who share content in laborious ways are more engaged than power users. If you copy a URL, paste it into TinyURL to shorten it, copy the shortened URL, go to the <a href="http://twitter.com">twitter.com</a> website, paste it into the box, add a comment — that’s a lot of work going into sharing, compared to someone who has all that kind of thing automated in a toolbar button. And the greater the amount of effort involved, the stronger the relationship between site and sharer, as a rule."
