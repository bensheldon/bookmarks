Having spent tons of time on algorithm-based products: just fake it and spend your time on marketing. and it's better to have a simple and satisfying first experience then creating an expectation for sustained data input over time. and if you can't/won't commit to mocking it up in Excel and running thru it a few times, why do you think someone else---with an even lower (or nonexistent) commitment to your product---will do it once you've put it on the internets. <br><br>At least in the nonprofit fundraising space I've heard and seen tons of pitches for some cognitive/psychological behavior-backed algorithm that will supposedly unlock people's wallets. Yeah, that's called "asking for money". And color me both skeptical and cynical all at once, but maybe the Ford Foundation should just have bought Farmville---we know that works.
