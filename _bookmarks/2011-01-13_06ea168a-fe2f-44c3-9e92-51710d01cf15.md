As a nonprofit nerd, I'm fascinated by the diplomatic dialogue over revoking Sea Shephard's tax exemption. Discretionary conception is dead, the only way would be if Sea Shephard was unlawful, which is unclear (and unprosecuted). Congress could issue a Bill of Attainder for federal grants (like with ACORN)---though Sea Shephard probably doesn't receive federal money, and such a bill would be overturned judicially (like with ACORN, though there was lasting damage) Probably the most effective way would be for the IRS to issue a rule like "donations in support of ships used primarily in non-US waters are taxable" or something that is narrow enough to apply to Sea Shephards activities without specifically singling them out. But regardless, it would be tough and litigious no matter what the government did.
