Recently I got an interesting question from someone looking for resources for Engineering Directors, as distinct from general engineering management:
 I was wondering if you’ve written any posts geared towards engineering directors or have any recs for posts others have written I’m mainly looking for advice on how to manage projects from two layers away. How do I give managers creative freedom to manage however they like while also stressing the importance of deadlines?
