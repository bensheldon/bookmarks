" In most of physics—and, indeed, in all of science—we rely on theory to understand our results. We build mathematical models and fit them to our results. But usually there are some parts of the system that remain unknown, or are too complicated to model, so we approximate the parts we can't model and leave the unknown parts as free parameters. Then, when the results don't fit, we vary the free parameters to make them fit."
