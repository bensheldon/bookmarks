From the comments:<br><br>> "Alice Bevan-McGregor says: If you consistently ignore the whining of the ignorant and produce a device built on a solid foundation of design, aesthetic, and usability (prioritizing <b>working</b> features over sheer numbers of crap features), your devices will continuously appear as magic to the unwashed, and underwhelming to the arrogant."
