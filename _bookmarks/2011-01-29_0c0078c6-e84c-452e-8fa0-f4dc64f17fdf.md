A nice looking bag, other than the overly-complex front pocket. Does anyone actually use all the pen-holders and zip pouches? I find I fill them up with pens and bandaids and such, then spill my coffee (or go on an airplane where all my pens explode) and have to empty it all out---more often than I actualy benefit from the bandaids and such.
