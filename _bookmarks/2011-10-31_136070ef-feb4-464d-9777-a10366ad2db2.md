> "The student left in the 1960s had believed that the revolution would start in their heads because that was where capitalist  power exerted its control. But it was a dead end because it led them into a terrible trap - where they became paralysed by the fear of possession.<br><br>> "As a result they became unable to articulate an inspiring vision of the future and came to distrust their own dreams because they were frightened that they would be immediately appropriated. And that is where much of the left still remain - paralysed by a dark pessimism and a fear of the cynicism of the media around them."
