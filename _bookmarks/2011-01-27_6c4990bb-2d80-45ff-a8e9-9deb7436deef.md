Best summary of the past few years of Boston political scandal, from the comments:<br><br>"See, what people are failing to understand is the key difference between, on the one hand, Turner and Wilkerson and, on the other, Finneran and DiMasi:<br><br>- Turner and Wilkerson arrogantly believed that they were above the law<br>- Finneran and DiMasi confidently knew that they were above the law"
