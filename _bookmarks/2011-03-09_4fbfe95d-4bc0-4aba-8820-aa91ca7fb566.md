This smacks me as a little weird, but I guess if you launch a website, you make a press release---and if that press release is coming from Craig Newmark, they print it. Not sure why this project wasn't done through the Craigslist Foundation though.<br><br>Funny story about the Foundation: A few years ago they applied for an AmeriCorps member through my program. After a few conversations and revisions, we approved their application for recruitment. 2 months pass, recruitment deadline comes and goes; they haven't recruited someone. I followup: they say they couldn't find a qualified candidate. I ask them how they did their search: they say just they advertised the position on Craigslist. [smack]<br><br>Their bootcamps are awesome (though they portray the nonprofit sector rather shallowly, though to be fair, most people do)
