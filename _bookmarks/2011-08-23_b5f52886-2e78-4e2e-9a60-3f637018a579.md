title: Why sex ed doesnâ€™t work

Gloucester is not representative. I don't think teens want babies for unconditional love (WTF is that, anyways?). I think anti-pregnancy sex ed works better for privileged kids, for whom "children will screw up your future" holds meaning, but for those who don't have a clear vision of opportunity in their future, it's less beneficial; at least for the "this is a scrotum" type of sex ed I had. If sex ed actually demystified biology and socio-cultural constructs, as opposed to just defining them---and was actually made a cross-curricular component (so you can have frank dissuasions about sex and relationships while reading "Catcher in the Rye" or "Jane Eyre"), it might be more useful generally. <br><br>Also raising a child is an important part of the human experience (which I think teens understand better than some bullshit called "unconditional love"), so why put it off when it's something they have control over now. And it's also sad that teens may have better access to counseling and family planning thru their school outside it.
