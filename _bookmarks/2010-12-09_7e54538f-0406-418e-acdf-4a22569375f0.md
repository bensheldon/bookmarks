For an explanation of Bleed (Full Bleed) see our Glossary.Create one PDF with a page size .25‚Äù (.68cm) larger in both width and height than the book chosen. For example, a 6 x 9" book will need a PDF with a page size of 6.25 x 9.25". The printer trims all four sides of the page equally. There is a .125 inch (.36cm) variation in the trimming process. Improperly sized or applied bleeds will result in a white strip or important parts of the image or text cut off at the edge of the page.
