This week I searched old emails and made a page containing all the nice things strangers have sent me about it, mainly because this makes me feel good.

The lessons here are:

Making simple little online tools is totally worth it, especially if the alternatives are usually covered in ads and tracking
Providing an obvious way for people to get in touch with you is important
There’s no shame in collecting it together like this because it’s nice for you and probably nice for users to see that they’re not the only ones who’ve been there
It’s really nice if you email someone to tell them you like something they’ve done.
