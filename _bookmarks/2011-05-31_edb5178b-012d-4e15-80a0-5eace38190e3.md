A Beautiful Boilerplate for Responsive, Mobile-Friendly Development

What Is It?
Skeleton is a small collection of CSS & JS files that can help you rapidly develop sites that look beautiful at any size, be it a 17" laptop screen or an iPhone. Skeleton is built on three core principles:


Responsive Grid Down To Mobile
Skeleton has a familiar, lightweight 960 grid as it's base, but elegantly scales down to downsized browser windows, tablets, mobile phones (in landscape and portrait). Go ahead, resize this page!


Fast to Start
Skeleton is a tool for rapid development. Get started fast with CSS best practices, a well-structured grid that makes mobile consideration easy, an organized file structure and super basic UI elements like lightly styled forms, buttons, tabs and more.


Style Agnostic
Skeleton is not a UI framework. It's a development kit that provides the most basic styles as a foundation, but is ready to adopt whatever your design or style is.
