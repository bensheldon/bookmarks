title: If You Want People to Actually Read What You Write
tags: []
---

Writers who make self-help lists need to reflect more on what they're trying to actually communicate (myself being in graphorhea recovery). Like what are you supposed to do with this: <br><br>"- Reduce the number of hard returns, especially in e-mails. They create visual noise.<br>- Avoid huge monolithic blocks of text. No one will read them."<br><br>What?! Why not just write "think about the physical structure of documents in context that effectively communicate to <b>you</b>. Try to copy that structure." Writing is about empathy with your reader so unless you are psychic (or psychopathic), self-knowledge is your best guide. <br><br>Of course, one sentence of advice doesn't sell books or juice ad impressions.
