title: Is This Real Life? In Defense of Our Virtual Connections

"Human relationships have many facets. When they’re real, they’re not real because of the things we use to cultivate them. They’re real because the human bond is there, the connection that extends beyond the means. "  It irritates me like no other when people say relationships arent real if they happen online.  Right-cuz every person Ive met offline has been a doll and we've become BFFs?  Hardly. Some of the most amazing people I know have come from the internetz.  Thx.
