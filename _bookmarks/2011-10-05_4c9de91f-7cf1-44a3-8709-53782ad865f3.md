I'm a follow-the-rules bicyclist, but I think Phil is wrong that scofflawism is what causes unpredictability (though I agree 100% that unpredictability is *the problem*). Bicyclists are "unpredictable" because most drivers have little relative experience both with bicyclists and as bicyclists. They know how to deal with bad drivers (who may blast thru a new red light, or cut an immediate left on a new green), but not so much bicyclists because there are relatively less of them than cars. Also because few drivers are bikers, they don't know why a bicyclist may try to take a lane if they see you trying to aggressively pass them coming to an intersection (to stop a potential right hook), for example. A lot of "unpredictable" bicycle actions are actually defensive bicycling; becoming a clear target is sometimes the best way to avoid becoming a victim ("they can't deny they didn't see me")---and none of it is illegal. <br><br>Which is why the best solution is education. Drivers should be trained in defensive bicycling just as much as bicyclists should be trained in the rules of the road.
