I want to agree, but the problem with higher ed is not higher ed, it's everything else: poor primary ed, lack of vocational schools and apprenticeships (NOT internships) and an overlooked community and city college system (not to mention a dysfunctional---so far as being non-exploitational---military and civil service). Also, universities DO need to churn thru students to winnow out those able to carry on into PhD programs and thus perpetuate the research system. The issue is that instead of choosing 1 out of 10 to go on to graduate school, it's now 1 out of 100 [these numbers are made up].
