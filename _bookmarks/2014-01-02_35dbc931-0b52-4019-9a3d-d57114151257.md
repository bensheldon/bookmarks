<blockquote>One of the hottest topics of the moment in the rails community is application design or architecture. There is an obsession (a good one, I think) with clean, decoupled code, that is easy to maintain and extend. This has led to things such as presenters, service objects, to some extent even rails concerns.
This is all fine and dandy, but I believe that in order to get closer to that utopic dream of the perfect system, more drastic and profound changes must happen. We need an architectural change, that shakes the foundations how we approach the writing and thought process of a rails application. To this, Uncle Bob has called the Clean Architecture.</blockquote>
