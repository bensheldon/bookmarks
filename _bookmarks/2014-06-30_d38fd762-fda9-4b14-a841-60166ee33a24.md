  how we present content on the Guardian

The anatomy of a container is as follows. A container contains multiple slices of content which can be combined in different ways. Inside a slice are different elements, each representing a single story. The content inside each container can be promoted differently through the use of volume controls and a container can also be skinned depending on tone. Building up each container from separate elements and then slices gives us an incredible amount of flexibility whilst reducing the amount of code needed to maintain it.
