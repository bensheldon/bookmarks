A great example of why I'm skeptical of knight funded projects. Rather than focusing on critical mass, I'd rather see a requirement of "minimal mass" : Who do you need participating in order to demonstrate a proof of concept of the outcome/social effects? Fund it in Stages:<br><br>1. Fund the outreach organizing of a minimal mass who will serve as focus groups during the development phase<br><br>2. Then fund development of the app buildout<br><br>This would help with what I dislike about knight App funded projects: not that they fund bad projects, but that the process is structured to encourage exactly these outcomes: a focus on a novel function/problem rather a novel audience (who then needs that function/solution).
