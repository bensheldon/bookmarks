I think she is correct. I think it\u2019s possible that for many, considering the shape of your life and then living it with vigor is so difficult because it cannot be externally validated. Unlike education and work, it offers no socially obvious meritocratic path. The moments where, like sourdough, it proves, are largely invisible \u2014 in cooking, in walking, corresponding with a friend, in chatting with a neighbor or registering to give blood. They cannot be tallied up and put on a resume. They are never \u201cfinished.\u201d The progress you make is spiraling rather than linear; circling steadily, slowly, around your weak points, taking two steps forward and one step back, building habits so slowly that only in retrospect can you see your life become different than it was. And there is no one who can tell you that you did it right. But this is not the condition of life under capitalism, this is life itself. And it is a sad irony that though the fear of life may be produced by class imperatives within capitalism, the impulse to restrict it to a problem of capitalism is itself part of the same fearful rejection of the task of living.","meta":"bb18d008affd44009400611ac753ff6b","hash":"eb836eada8580020e1fde42fa081706e","time":"2022-08-12T13:55:33Z","shared":"yes","toread":"yes","tags":""},

More broadly, it describes the ability to recognize patterns in one\u2019s own behavior. It\u2019s an example of metacognition, or thinking about one\u2019s own thinking, and it\u2019s something most humans are capable of but animals are not. And I believe the best test of whether an AI is really engaging in human-level cognition would be for it to demonstrate insight of this kind.\n\nInsight is precisely what Musk\u2019s strawberry-picking AI lacks, as do all the other AIs that destroy humanity in similar doomsday scenarios. I used to find it odd that these hypothetical AIs were supposed to be smart enough to solve problems that no human could, yet they were incapable of doing something most every adult has done: taking a step back and asking whether their current course of action is really a good idea. Then I realized that we are already surrounded by machines that demonstrate a complete lack of insight, we just call them corporations. Corporations don\u2019t operate autonomously, of course, and the humans in charge of them are presumably capable of insight, but capitalism doesn\u2019t reward them for using it. On the contrary, capitalism actively erodes this capacity in people by demanding that they replace their own judgment of what \u201cgood\u201d means with \u201cwhatever the market decides.\u201d","meta":"bba690ecdf031bd6f2789f7af4926523","hash":"7a1a5bd9f46c94b7ed3621a724acfbf9","time":"2021-10-13T18:47:27Z","shared":"yes","toread":"yes","tags":""},

You could be the greatest boss in the world and some people still wouldn\u2019t like you. Partly that\u2019s because being a good manager means giving feedback, addressing problems, and holding people accountable in ways they might not like. If you need to correct someone a lot, or have difficult conversations with them about their work, or say no to something they wanted, it\u2019s human nature that you might not end up being their favorite person. Or you might have a style that doesn\u2019t align well with theirs \u2014 maybe you\u2019re very direct and matter-of-fact and that feels brusque to them, or maybe you\u2019re a planner and a devotee of process and they work more spontaneously. That wouldn\u2019t mean either of you is in the wrong; it would just mean you don\u2019t mesh well together.\n\nSometimes, too, people dislike a job or a manager for reasons that aren\u2019t as much about the manager as they are about other things going on with that person \u2014 a dislike of their career path, stressors outside of work, a generally bad fit with the role, or all kinds of things.\n\nOr, frankly, you might be an imperfect manager \u2014 most of us are \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re a horrible one. Managing people is hard, and every manager will get things wrong now and then. Ideally you\u2019ll establish a track record of fairness, transparency, and good judgment so your mistakes are judged within that context \u2026 but you still might encounter an employee who judges your mistakes harshly. You\u2019re basically on a stage when you\u2019re the boss; you\u2019re going to be scrutinized by the people under you, and there will be things they take issue with. It\u2019s part of the job, and you\u2019ve got to be okay with that.\n\nOr, yes, you might be a terrible manager! It\u2019s possible. There are lots of terrible managers out there. But I\u2019m skeptical that you\u2019re terrible in the specific ways the review described (mean and intolerant of mistakes), because your detailed explanation of your approach to mistakes sounds pretty healthy and because you sound genuinely thoughtful and caring toward team members. People can delude themselves, of course, and managers aren\u2019t always reliable narrators of their own management styles. But the way you talk about how you operate \u2014 and your reaction now \u2014 doesn\u2019t seem to line up with that review or with the feedback people have given your boss about you. That doesn\u2019t mean that review is definitely wrong. I obviously can\u2019t say that with certainty. But I don\u2019t think it warrants the self-flagellation you\u2019re doing.","meta":"5a16ace5e658f1750778933fbe7085f9","hash":"68a009093ca8e9f752b4534783c8e87c","time":"2021-05-25T18:00:02Z","shared":"yes","toread":"yes","tags":""},

He wrote:\n\nThere are two kinds of people in science: bumblers and pointers. Bumblers are the people who get up every morning and make mistakes, trying to find truth but mainly tripping over their own feet, occasionally getting it right but typically getting it wrong. Pointers are the people who stand on the sidelines, point at them, and say \u201cYou bumbled, you bumbled.\u201d These are our only choices in life. If one is going to choose to do the easier of these two jobs, then one should at least know what one is talking about. Sorry, but I think by and large you don\u2019t.\n\nI think this dualism is counterproductive. If, instead of dividing the world into \u201cbumblers\u201d and \u201cpointers\u201d (and let me not even comment on the ridiculousness of a research psychologist making such a categorization and saying \u201cthese are our only choices in life\u201d), we were to consider \u201cbumbling\u201d and \u201cpointing\u201d to be two essential activities conducted by any scientist\u2014and, for that matter, if we were to recognize that one can and should spend lots of time criticizing one\u2019s own work (that is, \u201cpointing\u201d at our \u201cbumbling\u201d) and that we can and should consider criticism to itself be an ongoing development (that is, \u201cbumbling\u201d in our \u201cpointing\u201d)\u2014then, I think our research and our criticism could improve.\n\nTo draw a humble analogy from my experiences on the street: If each of us were to spend some time as a pedestrian, some time as a bicyclist, some time as a bus rider, and some time as a car driver, than I think we\u2019d all be able to interact more efficiently and considerately. But if we associate each person (or, in the sociology example, each area of expertise) with only one role, we get all kinds of trouble, as indicated by various psychology and biology researchers who can\u2019t seem to handle open criticism.","meta":"36a6a9c75cf0d5e9544424bf2b9ad95a","hash":"50fa8bf5c5b417b02499982ad7a62e57","time":"2020-10-31T14:51:13Z","shared":"yes","toread":"yes","tags":""},

To name only a few: Safiya Noble has written at length about the ways that the algorithms built by companies like Google and Facebook reinforce racism and sexism; Virginia Eubanks has exposed the ways in which high-tech tools of surveillance and control are first deployed against society\u2019s most vulnerable members; Wendy Hui Kyong Chun has explored how our usage of social media becomes habitual; Jen Schradie has shown the ways in which, despite the hype to the contrary, online activism tends to favor right-wing activists and causes; Sarah Roberts has pulled back the screen on content moderation to show how much of the work supposedly being done by AI is really being done by overworked and under-supported laborers; Ruha Benjamin has made clear the ways in which discriminatory designs get embedded in and reified by technical systems; Christina Dunbar-Hester has investigated the ways in which communities oriented around technology fail to overcome issues of inequality; Sasha Costanza-Chock has highlighted the need for an approach to design that treats challenging structural inequalities as the core objective, not an afterthought; Morgan Ames expounds upon the \u201ccharisma\u201d that develops around certain technologies; and Meredith Broussard has brilliantly inveighed against the sort of \u201ctechnochauvinist\u201d thinking\u2014the belief that technology is the solution to every problem\u2014that is so clearly visible in The Social Dilemma. To be clear, this list of critics is far from all-inclusive. There are numerous other scholars who certainly could have had their names added here, and there are many past critics who deserve to be named for their disturbing prescience.\n\nthe matter at hand is not to ask \u201cwhat kind of computers do we want?\u201d but to ask \u201cwhat kind of society do we want?\u201d and to then have the bravery to ask how (or if) computers really fit into that world\u2014and if they do fit, how ubiquitous they will be, and who will be responsible for the mining\/assembling\/disposing that are part of those devices\u2019 lifecycles. Certainly, these are not easy questions to ask, and they are not pleasant questions to mull over, which is why it is so tempting to just trust that the Center for Humane Technology will fix everything, or to just say that the problem is Silicon Valley.","meta":"0d7c6ea7832e9095f346642c68fd0c29","hash":"f797e655bb59d6036ccea0222a32fb63","time":"2020-10-26T03:03:40Z","shared":"yes","toread":"yes","tags":""},

Familiarize yourself with the dozen senior people at Shopify who have the final call on really important decisions, from Tobi and Harley on down. You need to familiarize yourself with their operating philosophy around business and around how Shopify works. Go consume every written memo and every podcast episode (we have a great internal podcast called Context) they\u2019ve ever done, get inside their heads, learn their perspectives and their preferences, and learn what gets them to say Yes to things. \n\n\u201cHere\u2019s why this is your most important job. In your first six months, you\u2019re gonna be useless anyways. You\u2019re going to be drowning in new information and context and it\u2019ll take you a few months to learn how to swim. But then once you do, you need to become effective. And in order to be effective, you need to know how to get those people to say Yes to things, and how they would think through a decision down to a detailed level. If you can do that, then you can get basically anything you want done. If you can\u2019t do that, then you\u2019re never going to get anything done. Therefore, this is your most important job right now.\u201d\n\nI remember thinking at the time, wow, that sounds like really important advice, I should listen. And I did put in some effort; not nearly enough, in retrospect, but more than zero. Now, six months in, I\u2019m not nearly at a point where I would consider myself \u201ceffective\u201d yet \u2013 I still have a long way to go in that department.

Some (usually on the right) like this model of development, others (usually on the left) find it dystopian, but they are unified in a pervasive view that such market structures are both inevitable and long-standing. I find such an attitude bizarre, not for any philosophical reason, but because concentrating wealth and power in monopolized markets was just not accepted as a legitimate way to do business for most of American history.\n\nFrom the 1600s to the 1970s, asking the question of how to constrain wealth and regulate prices was a core part of our tradition and ideology. Here is, for example, something from a 1779 pamphlet passed out in Philadelphia against profiteering during the Revolutionary War: \u201cYou that have money, and you that have none, down with your prices, or down with yourselves.\u2026 We have turned out against the enemy and we will not be eaten up by monopolizers and forestallers [aka speculators].\u201d\n\nThat legacy, hundreds of years old, is why Americans are mad when we are mistreated or overcharged. We aren\u2019t cynics and never have been, and we don\u2019t believe that our corporations and governing institutions should be corrupt. We know at one point they weren\u2019t. And that populist sentiment is bubbling up, in every nook and cranny of our society, because we know something about how we do business today is very wrong.\n\nIn the 1980s, most of our elites on the right and left were persuaded that monopolies were natural and, good or bad, simply the American Way. They changed policy accordingly, which is why most of the monopolies we know about were formed during or after that decade. But corruption and monopolization isn\u2019t natural, or inevitable. It\u2019s a choice we\u2019ve made, and a choice we can always undo. Remember that.\n\nWith that in mind, here are a few more sectors that have been monopolized. At the end, I\u2019ll offer ideas for what we can do about this problem (which isn\u2019t actually that difficult to address.)","meta":"7bb4f540bc6a0e91e9662514e8919085","hash":"e8040441e3b5bd62e666dfb26e92aa91","time":"2020-07-18T21:36:00Z","shared":"yes","toread":"yes","tags":""},

And now we\u2019re beginning to understand that this \u201cwe\u201d includes many other creatures and societies in our biosphere and even in ourselves. Even as an individual, you are a biome, an ecosystem, much like a forest or a swamp or a coral reef. Your skin holds inside it all kinds of unlikely co\u00f6perations, and to survive you depend on any number of interspecies operations going on within you all at once. We are societies made of societies; there are nothing but societies. This is shocking news\u2014it demands a whole new world view. And now, when those of us who are sheltering in place venture out and see everyone in masks, sharing looks with strangers is a different thing.

To me, the joy of writing about a text is the twisting, rupturing, pleasurable unpleasure of unforming and being\u00a0unformed as I work to shape an argument. To read a book to its core, to get under its skin and let it get under yours, is to engage with it in a mutual process of transformation and sometimes-ecstatic contortion. This is, some might say, highly un-professional (whatever this profession is), definitely un-objective, possibly even un-ethical. But for me, to write a piece of living interpretation, to share in gutsy, real conversation with a piece of art, is always to invoke form as a verb, not just to submit to the noun of its existence\u2014a forming that is process-oriented but not simply procedural\u2014and to somehow animate that constant movement in words. In my life as a critic, as in Ferrante, this is an impossible yet irresistible desire: the little stories I\u2019ve told you along the way here, my shape-making narrative impulses, are the legible coverings that skim over the roiling blurriness of ongoing forming-unforming beneath, the frantumaglia\u2014that dialect word that Ferrante uses to mean \u201cbits and pieces,\u201d magma, a jumbled tangle that refuses reduction\u2014of reading and being read (shades of Calvino here, too).

However well intentioned white liberals were about remedying racial inequality, their \u00e9litism was steadfast. At Yale, some of Thomas\u2019s classmates would query the absence of class rankings and grades. \u201cYou do not separate cream from cream,\u201d a professor responded. \u201cIt is your fate as a Yale Law School student to become one of the leaders in the legal profession. It will happen, not because of you personally, but because you are here. That is what happens to Yale Law School students.\u201d But Yale\u2019s black students were separated from the cream; indeed, the absence of rankings was used to effect that separation. As he approached graduation, Thomas tried to secure a position at an \u00e9lite law firm in Atlanta, which had no black associates. One of the marks against him was that he had no grades.

In a product organization, users typically only interact with the end product, rarely interacting with the team directly that produces that product. As a result, the customer is abstracted from changes to a team\u2019s composition. However, in many services organizations the individual members of the team may interact closely with the organization\u2019s client. In these situations, clients will often form attachments to certain high-performing members of the team and resist any changes which could result in those members leaving that client\u2019s project. This can make it very difficult for an organization to honor a request from an individual to leave a certain project without also risking the alienation of key client.","meta":"8281719d87ddbb5b4f302f4d350f9887","hash":"a66d6f55078d14903fdb2d19f0855683","time":"2019-07-31T13:56:55Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":""},

But scientists have found that, at a younger age, those who go on to become elite athletes typically devote less time to deliberate practice in the activity in which they will eventually become experts. Instead, they undergo what researchers call a \u201csampling period\u201d. They play a variety of sports, usually in an unstructured or lightly structured environment; they gain a range of physical proficiencies from which they can draw; they learn about their own abilities and proclivities; and only later do they focus in on one area. The title of one study of athletes in individual sports proclaimed \u201clate specialisation\u201d as \u201cthe key to success\u201d; another was titled Making It to the Top in Team Sports: Start Later, Intensify, and Be Determined.","meta":"f58a8e0774a903c94e77b63863f77b5a","hash":"99aa9d7c4819ac93d49213e55f1010c6","time":"2019-07-14T16:19:58Z","shared":"yes","toread":"yes","tags":""},

Many interview processes are unclear about what they\u2019re evaluating, and those are the most susceptible to testing for signaling over skills. The good news is that designing interview formats that effectively test the identified skills is a very mechanical skill that anyone can develop with practice: I\u2019ve gotten to participate in several interview loop revamps that took that approach to good effect.

You learn the rules and use them to your advantage. So teach your kids when they\u2019re young that the higher the stakes the game is, the more arcane the rules are. And the more arcane the rules, the more likely it is that you can find a backdoor route to the top.  But pretending the system is a meritocracy encourages more discrimination \u2013\u2013 so says economist Robert Frank. And belief that one has succeeded inside a meritocracy leads to more self-congratulatory, selfish behavior. Frank says people who accept that all of life is about skill and luck are much more likely to be thankful and therefore more generous.  Bottom line: Gaming the system is a great idea, but you can\u2019t game the system if you don\u2019t have good grades. Hard work counts too. So raise a kid who has gratitude. Because when it comes to being a happy person, having gratitude is much more important than having a fancy diploma.","meta":"d8f2af2ead62a08e23ba497a5bd406aa","hash":"aca7cff729b13fd18d5d188e525f2489","time":"2019-03-17T02:58:11Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":""},

Articulate the specific results or behaviors that would demonstrate mastery. Use the same criteria for all employees at this level.\nSet a goal to discuss three specific business outcomes with all employees. If you can\u2019t think of those outcomes for a particular employee, dig deeper or ask the employee or their peers to provide more details.\nSystematically tie feedback \u2014 either positive or developmental \u2014 to business and goals outcomes. If you find yourself giving feedback without tying it to outcomes (e.g., \u201cPeople like working with you\u201d), ask yourself whether you can further tie the feedback to specific results (e.g., \u201cYou are effective at building team outcomes. You successfully resolved the divide between the engineering team and the product team on which features to prioritize in our last sprint, leading us to ship the product on time.\u201d).\nWhen evaluating people in similar roles, equalize references to technical accomplishments and capability. Notice when detail is lacking for a particular employee and make an extra effort to determine whether something, either a skill or a developmental need, has been missed.\nStrive to write reviews of similar lengths for all employees.

I'm Not So Sure.","extended":"So one of the things that's really funny in social games is learning how social actually helps relieve challenges or pinches in the game,\" said LeTourneau. \"Every game has a pinch, you know, Super Mario has a pinch, in that I only have so many lives.\" (Again with the Nintendo comparisons.)P\n\n\"MMOs don't punish you that much either, for failure in the game. Because they want you to keep playing.\"\nNintendo's famous platformers have a distinct pinch, as LeTourneau points out. If you make a mistake, you lose a life and progress, and if you run out of lives, you fail and lose the game. But what exactly is the pinch of a Ville game? As I mentioned before, one of my main criticisms of Zynga's games is that they're so positive that they feel meaningless. Compare FarmVille 2 to SimCity, where your city can turn on you, your people can go homeless, and a fire can burn down everything you've built. What are you up against in FarmVille 2?P\n\n\"I'd say first and foremost, in most social games, what you're really combatting is time,\" LeTourneau said. \"For example, that your crops wither if you don't come back and take care of them. So it is really positive, the pinch is really the speed at which we progress, or really, the loss of your effort. But I think that how these games are different is that in something like Sim City, I would continually be resetting the board. I wipe out my city and I start over. These [social games] are really different. I think they're much more almost MMO-like in that respect. Which is, how much would it suck if every time I came back to World of Warcraft, if you'd been away for a while, or if you died in a dungeon, and all of a sudden you reset to level 40. MMOs don't punish you that much either, for failure in the game. Because they want you to keep playing.\"\n","meta":"2e22b06de45bbb8b3b74095cc109839e","hash":"79e73f5dac5f75de5ee93b66ff1fc5b8","time":"2013-10-09T18:38:47Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"games design"},

{"href":"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Design\/comments\/x9fi6\/your_logo_is_bad_and_you_should_feel_bad_from_a\/","description":"Your logo is bad and you should feel bad: From a printer\/designer about your unprintable logos. : Design","extended":"Alright designers, it's back to basics.\r\nI keep seeing posts about designers asking for critiques on their logos. 9 times out of ten, your logo is unprintable and doesn't take into consideration that it will be shown in all different sizes and on different mediums. It's absurd how few designers actually have a good grasp on what goes into printing your logo (and I'm not talking about you shitty Epson CMYK home printer.) So, without further ado here is a small checklist on why you need to revise your logos:\r\n\u2022 Start your logo by only working in black.\r\nStraight up, only use black. C0M0Y0K100. Don't you fucking dare touch the opacity or consider putting that K down to 50 or 20 or whatever. Do everything in black. This is your 1 color logo. When you have a one color logo THEN you can start coloring that fucker. Also, limit the number of colors you use. 4 is a good maximum number, but I try to stick around 3.\r\n\u2022 Limit your gradients and expect resistance.\r\nGradients are the bane of a printer's existence. It may look great on computer monitor, but hand it to a flexographic printer and he might as well tell you to go fuck yourself. Gradients don't translate well in print. Even in CMYK printing, they can be messy and don't have the same tolerance from one color to another, printer to printer.\r\n\u2022 For the love of god, play with your logo.\r\nSo, you've created a logo, huh? Well here's what you need to do. Print it. As small as you fucking can without losing it's integrity. Not very legible? Did your anorexic ultra-thin type disappear? Yeah, time to go back to the drawing board. Create versions of logo that can be placed horizontally, vertically and without type (unless the typography is your logo). Your skinny type isn't going to show up on a piece of fabric because it's going to be lost on the threads. Always have longevity and functionality in mind when you design! That's design 101, and it's amazing how many designers forget that.\r\nI get told a lot by a lot of amateur\/small time designers that, \"This is 2012, my logo can be as complex as I want!\" Fuck you, and here's why:\r\n\u2022 Printing is expensive.\r\nI don't know if you know this, but CMYK printer ink is more expensive than human blood. That's why you need to think ahead and consider alternative printing methods. That's why you need a 1 color logo. You have clients. Clients aren't into the most elaborate bang for their buck. They are looking for ways to cut down on costs and maximize profit. You owe them that.\r\nThe other thing is that using alternative printing methods price by the number of plates\/screens\/inks used. Right now, my printer charges $200\/flexographic plate made up. 1 plate = 1 color. So, LIMIT THE NUMBER OF COLORS YOU USE, because YOU WILL end up having it printed or someone else will print it for you (ie, sponsor, advertisement, etc). And I'm sure you want it looking good and recognizable.\r\nWhat alternative methods? I'm talking about offset and flexographic and screen printing. All of these forms of printing have their pros and cons, but all are meant for mass production. You need to learn how each of these work, because it's important to know what to expect.\r\nAnyway, I am willing to answer any questions. Let's also hear the more veteran printers\/designers put forth their advice. Cheers\r\nEDIT:\r\nA few other points should have been made thanks to other's posts.\r\n\u2022 VECTOR\r\nYour logo needs to be vectored, converted to outlines and expanded. Turn it in as wither an EPS or Illustrator PDF file. If you don't know what that means, then you probably aren't a designer.\r\n\u2022 Pantones.\r\nBuy yourself a pantone book, preferably 2 for solid color coated and uncoated inks. A pro-tip is to work from pantones. Convert all of your CMYK colors and RGB colors from a Pantone color first. It is much easier to match from a pantone color than to match TO a pantone color.\r\n\u2022 Color Match\r\nFinicky about colors? It's your job as a designer to request that your colors be color matched to an already made up hard copy. Inks are typically transparent and the paper or substrate behind the ink has a tendency to come through. That means your logo has a chance of always being printed darker than it's intended color. Ask for your colors to be color matched against an already perfect print of yours on the paper or medium you are printing it on.\r\n\u2022 You signed it, it's your fault.\r\nThis one is simple. If you sign that proof, the ink is on your hands. Don't be angry at the printer. Printers may be nice and try to accommodate for your mistake (cheaper re-run, maybe?), but all in all, you are probably going to eat that cost.","meta":"aa189509fef3a62d46b10ed41e2f51e2","hash":"b6f2562ab19c5db3a817ef238eb90ec3","time":"2012-07-28T03:03:54Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"design"},

They are both exciting and a fascinating topic to explore in any programming language.  One reason for this is that they help us build upon the combined experience of many developers that came before us and ensure we structure our code in an optimized way, meeting the needs of problems we're attempting to solve.  Design patterns also provide us a common vocabulary to describe solutions. This can be significantly simpler than describing syntax and semantics when we're attempting to convey a way of structuring a solution in code form to others.  In this book we will explore applying both classical and modern design patterns to the JavaScript programming language.","meta":"965a0e632022cdda264583a035bd8fd1","hash":"140dd8a1ef55750d858eab3084146dd0","time":"2012-04-20T15:55:54Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"javascript"},

Matt applies this to Instagram:  What is the labour encoded in Instagram? It\u2019s easy to see. Every \u201cuser\u201d of Instagram is a worker. There are some people who produce photos \u2014 this is valuable, it means there is something for people to look it.

Passive methods (such as increasing potential rewards for everyone) do improve participation by women, but they also improve men's performance as well, which leaves the gender gap in place. Affirmative action, on the other hand, not only changes the odds of success by women, but (according to the authors of a related study) also increases their confidence and willingness to compete in the first place.   If the competitors know they have a higher chance of success before the contest even begins, the authors suggest, they are more likely to enter it with a positive view of their own abilities. In addition, excessive confidence in male competitors is reduced because they know rewards will be distributed in a different manner.","meta":"4a7f6656ff9edf1789a90ba3a9c62e23","hash":"3bfc979333edc034c1f3683994b98d10","time":"2012-02-03T13:17:14Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"contests diecrimination"},

Bicyclists are \"unpredictable\" because most drivers have little relative experience both with bicyclists and as bicyclists. They know how to deal with bad drivers (who may blast thru a new red light, or cut an immediate left on a new green), but not so much bicyclists because there are relatively less of them than cars. Also because few drivers are bikers, they don't know why a bicyclist may try to take a lane if they see you trying to aggressively pass them coming to an intersection (to stop a potential right hook), for example. A lot of \"unpredictable\" bicycle actions are actually defensive bicycling; becoming a clear target is sometimes the best way to avoid becoming a victim (\"they can't deny they didn't see me\")---and none of it is illegal. <br><br>Which is why the best solution is education.

If sex ed actually demystified biology and socio-cultural constructs, as opposed to just defining them---and was actually made a cross-curricular component (so you can have frank dissuasions about sex and relationships while reading \"Catcher in the Rye\" or \"Jane Eyre\"), it might be more useful generally. <br><br>Also raising a child is an important part of the human experience (which I think teens understand better than some bullshit called \"unconditional love\"), so why put it off when it's something they have control over now.

Skeleton is built on three core principles:\r\n\r\n\r\nResponsive Grid Down To Mobile\r\nSkeleton has a familiar, lightweight 960 grid as it's base, but elegantly scales down to downsized browser windows, tablets, mobile phones (in landscape and portrait).

Get started fast with CSS best practices, a well-structured grid that makes mobile consideration easy, an organized file structure and super basic UI elements like lightly styled forms, buttons, tabs and more.\r\n\r\n\r\nStyle Agnostic\r\nSkeleton is not a UI framework. It's a development kit that provides the most basic styles as a foundation, but is ready to adopt whatever your design or style is.\r\n\r\n","meta":"04582adad65f766040559bdefaf0f860","hash":"9be22e8e277340406ea2bfab8727503f","time":"2011-05-31T17:53:39Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"webdesign css html"},

Duration: 15 min (assuming light editing\/anxiety over appropriateness)<br><br>2. Same quotes as #1, but this time lightly criticize, compare or contrast between them or somehow contemporize. If you've built up a collection of quotes, it's fairly easy to pull 2 contrasting ones and write a light paragraph to fit between them with your analysis. Length: 30 min.(assuming you already have the quotes and can bang out a quick explanatory connection). <br><br>3. Write down a conversation that has already taken place. This requires a higher level of literacy, but you're basically rehashing the arguments you've already made---with maybe a brief conclusion where you say \"I should have explained x better\" (but don't actually explain it, just acknowledge you recognize the holes and let them sit). Duration: ~1 hour (depending on complexity and your level of honesty in narrative)<br><br>4. Original analysis: avoid at all costs.

By using this new method I\u2019ve done away with unsafe $_GET variables and can now use any builtin WP functions in the external file.\r\nFirst you\u2019ll need to edit your functions.php file and add this block of code.\r\n\r\nadd_filter('query_vars', 'add_new_var_to_wp');\r\nfunction add_new_var_to_wp($public_query_vars) {\r\n    $public_query_vars[] = 'my_theme_custom_var';\r\n    \/\/my_theme_custom_var is the name of the custom query variable that is created and how you reference it in the call to the file\r\n    return $public_query_vars;\r\n}\r\nThis sets up WP to now accept a new variable in a query called my_theme_custom_var the format of the query would be http:\/\/www.yourblog.com\/index.php?my_theme_custom_var=css . The ? mark tells WP that this is a query and the = sign tells what the query variable should be set to.\r\n\r\nNow to actually setup the function that will call the external file. I found this gem when looking at how popular WP theme called Atahualpa handled it\u2019s external CSS.\r\n\r\nadd_action('template_redirect', 'my_theme_css_display');\r\nfunction my_theme_css_display(){\r\n    $css = get_query_var('my_theme_custom_var');\r\n    if ($css == 'css'){\r\n        include_once (TEMPLATEPATH . '\/style.php');\r\n        exit;  \/\/This stops WP from loading any further\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nThis code now will check if a query is passed to WP with the value my_theme_custom_var and if it is and has the value of css then it includes the style.php file which is our dynamic CSS file. Then the code exits which stops any other functions from happening other wise the whole home page is outputted along with the style.php file, which isn\u2019t what is needed only the file.\r\nNow you can use any WP functions on the style.php file as it is included from the functions.php file which is a standard WP file.\r\nSource : Will Norris","meta":"a1b7c12e0679df851cad46b8aebd4ef5","hash":"e726c74b40ae2fa31edc9bb339dbc34b","time":"2011-04-26T19:44:07Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"wordpress development webdesign"},

{"href":"http:\/\/law.bepress.com\/umichlwps\/empirical\/art15\/","description":"University of Michigan Legal Working Paper Series","extended":"American nonprofit organizations receive favorable tax treatment, including tax exemptions and tax-deductibility of contributions, in return for their devotion to charitable purposes and restrictions not to distribute profits. Recent efforts to extend some or all of these tax benefits to for-profit companies making social investments, including the creation of the new hybrid nonprofit\/for-profit company form known as the Low-Profit Limited Liability Company, threaten to undermine the vitality of the nonprofit sector and the integrity of the tax system.\r\nReform advocates maintain that the ability to compensate executives based on performance and to distribute profits when attractive investment opportunities are scarce makes for-profit entities more efficient than nonprofit counterparts. Offering more favorable tax treatment to for-profits engaging in charity would encourage greater charitable entrepreneurship, the argument goes, and provide worthwhile competition for the nonprofit sector. As matters stand, however, nonprofits can and occasionally do reward executives with performance-based compensation, and their nondistribution rules impose no obligation to make subpar investments. The existing nonprofit sector is extremely competitive, and the charitable activities of for-profits already receive favorable tax treatment. Going further and offering socially active for-profits the tax benefits equivalent to those available currently to nonprofits would create opportunities for tax arbitrage by providing tax deductions to high-bracket donors and taxable income for lightly taxed recipients. The difficulty of policing lines between nonprofit and for-profit activities of the same business entities would entail significant administrative complexity and is unlikely ultimately to succeed. And even should it succeed, the costs of offering new tax benefits to for-profit charities include not only foregone tax revenues, but also spillover effects on the charitable activities of nonprofits.","meta":"7df0cb423f743de89c53290832d16d33","hash":"9be0073c028d1a2437297499d6cf2432","time":"2011-02-08T18:17:49Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"nonprofit law"},

Combine in a large bowl one cup (237 ml) of whole wheat flour, one cup (237 ml) of rye flour, one cup (237 ml)of cornmeal \u2014 usually yellow \u2014 1 1\/2 teaspoon (7.4 ml) baking soda, and one teaspoon (4.9 ml) salt. If desired, one cup (237 ml) of raisins can be added at this stage, taking care to separate any raisins that are stuck together.\r\n\r\nNext, in a smaller bowl, combine two cups (473 ml) of buttermilk and 3\/4 cup (177 ml) molasses. Stir this mixture into the dry ingredients, stopping as soon as all ingredients are moist. Fill the greased cans with the dough, and cover them with aluminum foil. To seal the cans, two layers of aluminum foil can be used, which can then be fastened around the can with string or rubber bands.\r\n\r\nFill a pot with water, and put some type of rack in the pans, for the cans to rest on. Put the pot, with the rack and cans in it, over a burner on low, and add boiling water until the water level reaches halfway to the top of the cans. Cover the pot, bringing the water to a gentle boil. Steam the bread this way \u2014 adding more boiling water if necessary \u2014 for two and a half to three hours, stopping when an inserted toothpick comes out clean. Carefully slide the Boston brown bread out of the can. This will be much easier if the cans were well greased before adding the dough!","meta":"f9ffe8c8827fa1601f1e3631593d69da","hash":"5919565a01de344ff21d6613b174014f","time":"2011-01-12T01:35:53Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"Recipe"},

However, the contemporary philosopher Hans-Georg Gadamer has said that hermeneutics is an approach rather than a method and, further, that the hermeneutic circle is the central problem of interpretation.\n","meta":"3390527ff38cdd7306d603d287c6c649","hash":"c0ddaf9020b5fb5a1dec33a4b84fe33c","time":"2008-10-14T01:43:16Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"wikipedia philosophy learning theory"},

It's hard to imagine someone victimized by workplace rumors summarizing them and posting them on the lunchroom wall. The conventional wisdom about rumors is to take the high road and not respond. When John McCain, during the 2000 Republican primaries, was plagued with rumors that he had fathered an illegitimate child, for the most part he opted not to engage with them at all.

For many years it was a privilege to hold a nonprofit charter. This view changed during the 1950s and 1960s. A new generation contended that legal theory, racial justice, and democratic values demanded that the nonprofit corporate form be available to all groups as a matter of right. As a result, nonprofit corporate status became America's corporate form for free expression. The new perspective did more than enlarge public discourse, however. It also reduced official authority to supervise or otherwise hold nonprofit organizations accountable for their activities. Norman I.
